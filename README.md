# Employee Salary Analysis (Python)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores **employee salary data** to understand how compensation varies across different roles, experience levels, and organizational factors.  
Using Python and exploratory data analysis (EDA), the project uncovers trends, distributions, and potential salary drivers within the workforce.

The objective is to transform raw salary data into **actionable insights** that can support HR decision-making, compensation benchmarking, and workforce planning.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze salary distribution across employees
- Identify salary differences by **job role**, **experience**, and **department**
- Explore relationships between salary and employee attributes
- Visualize compensation trends to support data-driven insights

---

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains employee-level salary information, including demographic and job-related attributes.

### Typical Features Include:
- Employee role / designation
- Experience or years of service
- Salary
- Department or job category
- Additional employee attributes (as provided in the dataset)

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 1️⃣ Salary Distribution
- Analyzed overall salary distribution using histograms and boxplots
- Identified salary ranges, median compensation, and potential outliers

---

### 2️⃣ Salary by Job Role
- Compared average and median salaries across different job roles
- Identified roles with the highest and lowest compensation levels

---

### 3️⃣ Experience vs Salary
- Examined how salary changes with increasing experience
- Observed positive trends between years of experience and compensation

---

### 4️⃣ Department-Level Analysis
- Analyzed salary variation across departments
- Highlighted departments with higher average compensation

---

### 5️⃣ Outlier Detection
- Identified unusually high or low salaries
- Assessed whether outliers were role-specific or experience-driven

---

### 6️⃣ Correlation Analysis
- Explored correlations between salary and numerical features
- Identified key variables influencing compensation trends

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- Salary levels vary significantly by job role and experience
- Higher experience generally corresponds to higher compensation
- Certain departments consistently offer higher average salaries
- A small number of outliers may indicate senior or specialized roles

---

## 📌 Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of Python for salary data analysis, including data cleaning, visualization, and exploratory analysis.
It highlights how compensation insights can be derived from structured employee data to support business and HR decisions.
